# Workday Scheduler
The purpose of this project was to create a simple calendar application that allows the end user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

- Utilized Moment.js to call the exact time and date
- Used JavaScript JSON functions to utilize local storage
